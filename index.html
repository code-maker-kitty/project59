            Nintendo has continually innovated in the video game space and revolutionized an industry:

            The Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) was the first video game controller to feature a directional pad, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) was the first controller to feature right- and left-shoulder buttons, and the Nintendo 64 (N64) popularized the analog thumbstick.

            The company that developed the Wii motion technology offered it to Microsoft and Sony first (who both turned down the technology), and Nintendo ultimately introduced motion control to the masses!.
